## 🧭 Guidelines & Instruction Paths

### 1. Building Applications with Quatrain
If the task is to construct or design application schemas, models, repositories, and business features **using** the Quatrain ecosystem, follow the guidelines in:
👉 [AGENTS.md (Application Development Guidelines)](./guidelines/AGENTS.md)

### 2. Modifying Quatrain Core Codebase
If the task requires editing, refactoring, fixing, or extending the packages, monorepo workspaces, containers, or CI/CD pipelines of the **Quatrain Core repository itself**, follow the strict guidelines in:
👉 [CONTRIBUTING_AGENTS.md (Monorepo Contributing Guidelines)](./guidelines/CONTRIBUTING_AGENTS.md)

## 👤 Personal Rules & Custom Settings

In addition to the framework-level guidelines, you MUST adhere to the user's personal coding preferences, custom shortcuts, and general development rules published in their dedicated Gist:

## 🛑 Strict TypeScript & Code Quality Rules

- **No `as any` Type Bypasses**: Never use `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, or type assertion shortcuts to silence TypeScript errors. Always construct fully compliant, strongly-typed objects that satisfy the target interfaces and schemas.
